# Plotting SEM models using ggraph

A recurring need in statistics is to create plots composed of nodes and edges.
This need arises for structural causal models, network analyses but also for psychometric latent factor models.

I try to do all my visualizations in `ggplot`. This allows me to build on what I learned previously, and increase my productivity with this tool. The grammar of graphics has been adapted to work with networks /graphs in the tidygraph / ggraph packages, so let's give them a go!

# How can network / relational data be tidy?

In the words of **Thomas Lin Pedersen**, the creator of tidygraph and ggraph:

>Both node and edge data by itself fits very well within the tidy concept, as each node and edge is, in a >sense, a single observation. Thus, a close approximation of tidyness for relational data is two tidy data >frames, one describing the node data and one describing the edge data.

Let 's try to make a simple model for a Structural Equation Model (SEM) of a latent trait "Intelligence". 
This trait is measured by three questions (items), that are observed.
The three items have different "factor loadings", numbers that we want to plot in the graph.

We begin with loading the required R packages.
We need both **tidygraph** (for the tidy object to hold the data) as well as **ggraph** (to plot the data).

```{r }
library(ggraph)
library(tidygraph)
```

# Prep data to plot

We start with defining the nodes.
We want a specific layout, so we define all positions manually.

For SEM models, the convention is to represent latent traits as circles, and measured (observed) variables as squares. We encode each nodes type as a variable "latent" (TRUE or FALSE).

```{r}
# nodes
param_nodes <- data.frame(name = c("Item 1", 
                                   "Item 2", 
                                   "Item 3", 
                                   "Intelligence"))

# circle or square symbol
param_nodes$latent <- c(F, F, F, T)

# positions (ggplot drawing surface scales from 0 to 1 in both dimensions)
param_nodes$x <- c(0, 0, 0, 1)

param_nodes$y <- c(0, 0.5, 1, 0.5)

param_nodes$nsize <- c(24, 24, 24, 36)

# shift the labels to be at the center of the node location
param_nodes$label_hjust <- c(1, 1, 1, 1)*0.5

param_nodes$label_vjust <- c(1, 1, 1, 1)*0.5
```

The edges define the connections between the nodes. They all originate from the latent node.

```{r}
# edges
param_edges <- data.frame(from = c( 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4), 
                            to = c( 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3))

param_edges$coef <- c(1, 1, 1, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7)
param_edges$error <- c("e1", "e2","e3", NA, NA, NA)
```

We use `tbl_graph()` to combine both the node and edge datasets into a tidygraph object.

```{r}
# create tidygraph object
my_tidygraph <- tidygraph::tbl_graph(param_nodes, 
                                    param_edges)
```

# Make the plot

Now we are ready to make the plot. We use the `manual` layout to make ggraph use our predefined x- and y positions. `geom_edge_link()` and `geom_node_point()` do most of the work.

I needed to use four `scale_*()` calls to get all the scales right.

* Two to expand the drawing area to avoid the nodes from falling partly outside the drawing area,
* One to get the symbol sizes right,
* And one two manually specify the symbol shapes

```{r fig.width= 5, fig.height = 5}

hp <- ggraph(my_tidygraph,
             layout = "manual", 
             x = x, y = y) +
  geom_edge_link(aes(label = coef),
                 label_dodge = unit(2.5, 'mm'),
                 alpha = 1,
                 linetype = 1, 
                 angle_calc = "along",
                 start_cap = circle(1.2, 'cm'),
                 end_cap = circle(1.0, 'cm'),
                 arrow = arrow(angle = 45, 
                               length = unit(0.5, "cm"), 
                               type = "closed",
                               ends = "last")
                 ) +
  geom_edge_loop(
                 start_cap = circle(1.2, 'cm'),
                 end_cap = circle(1.2, 'cm'),
                 arrow = arrow(angle = 45, 
                               length = unit(0.5, "cm"), 
                               type = "closed"),
                 aes(span = 90, direction = 180)) + 
  geom_node_point(aes(shape = as.factor(latent), size = nsize),
                  color = "grey") +
  # Node names
  geom_node_text(aes(label = name,  hjust = label_hjust,
                 vjust = label_vjust), size = 5) + 
  # Get the scaling right
  scale_x_continuous(expand = expand_scale(0.2)) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = expand_scale(0.2)) +
  # geom_point(x = 0, y = 0, col = "red") + 
  # geom_point(x = 0, y = 1, col = "red") + 
  # geom_point(x = 1, y = 0, col = "red") + 
  # geom_point(x = 1, y = 1, col = "red") + 
  # geom_point(x = 1.2, y = 1.2, col = "red") + 
  scale_size_continuous(range = c(24, 36)) +
  scale_shape_manual(values = c(15, 19), guide = FALSE) +
  ggtitle('Single latent factor model') + 
  theme_graph() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

hp
```

Finally, display the plot.

```{r fig.width = 5, fig.height = 5}
hp
```


Hell yeah! 

PM add error correlation structure.
