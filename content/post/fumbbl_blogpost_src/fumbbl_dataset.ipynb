    "# Construction of a public dataset of Blood Bowl matches played on FUMBBL.com\n",
    "\n",
    "This blogpost is about **Blood Bowl**, a boardgame I started playing last year. The goal of this blog post is to use Python API and HTML scraping to fetch online Blood Bowl match outcome data, and to create a structured dataset ready for analysis and visualization. \n",
    "\n",
    "In 2020, a new version of the Blood Bowl board game came out with several changes to the rules, and to the available teams to play with.\n",
    "Last september, the online Blood Bowl gaming website **FUMBBL** switched to the new ruleset (\"BB2020\"), with players largely abandoning the previous ruleset (from 2016, \"BB2016\" hereafter). With a daily game volume of a few hundred matches, I decided it would be interesting to analyse the win rates of the different teams (or \"races\", given the fantasy world setting), and how these have been impacted by the new ruleset. This is important, because races can get **nerfed** (made weaker) or **buffed** (made stronger) when new versions of the ruleset are released. These changes are common in any gaming community, in an attempt to achieve more balance in the game. We examine whether the current \"three tier\" system to balance the strength differences between teams is optimal. The results can inform changes that improve balance.\n"

Using only open source tooling reduces the barriers for others to take what i created and build on it. Apart from having Python installed, you need a code editor. Jupyter Notebooks can be read by many code editors, such as Jupyterlab, or Pycharm, i decided to try out [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), or **VS code** for short. It ticks all my boxes such as being cross platform (I use linux at home and Windows at work), being open source, and having a large user base, as [visible on Github](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) with more than 125K stars. It works pretty well, the only thing I really miss is have a [Python console connected to the same kernel my Notebook is running on](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54987778/is-it-possible-to-link-the-interactive-python-window-to-a-running-jupyter-notebo)."

We also want to compare with the previous ruleset, where we have much more data available. How far do we go back? \n",

    "# Dataprep: transforming the team values\n",
    "\n",
    "In Blood Bowl, teams can develop themselves over the course of multiple matches. The winnings of each match can be spend on buying new, stronger players, or replace the players that ended up getting injured or even killed. In addition, players receive so-called *star points* for important events, such as scoring, or inflicting a casualty on the opponent. Therefore, a balancing mechanism is needed when when a newly created \"rookie\" team is facing a highly developed opponent with lots of extra skills and strong players. \n",
    "Blood Bowl solves this by calculating for both teams their **Current team value**.\n",
    "The **Team value difference** for a match determines the amount of gold that the weaker team can use to buy so-called **inducements**.\n",
    "These inducements are temporary, and can consists of a famous \"star player\" who joins the team just for this match. Another popular option is to hire a wizard that can be used to turn one of the opposing players into a frog.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is well known that the win rates of the teams depend on how developed a team is. For example, Amazons are thought to be strongest at low team value, as they already start out with lots of *block* and *dodge* skills, whereas a Chaos team start out with almost no skills.\n",
    "So if we compare win rates, we would like take into account the current team value. \n",
    "Now as this can differ between the two teams in a match up, I reasoned that the highest team value is most informative about the average development level of both teams, because of the inducement mechanism described above.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the dataset, we have for each match the current team values of both teams. Importantly, we do not have information on inducements.\n",
    "We discuss later what this means for the conclusions we can draw. Here we transform the text string `1100k` into an integer number `1100`, so that we can calculated the difference, and pick for each match the maximum team value and store it as `tv_match`.\n"

    "\n",
    "For example, in football, there is a popular weighting scheme where wins are given 3 points, draws 1 point and losses 0 points.\n",
    "This is called [three points for a win](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_points_for_a_win) . \n",
    "In Blood bowl leagues and tournaments, this rule is often used as well.\n",
    "So, if we want to predict which teams perform best in these settings (have the highest probability of winning a tournament), we need to weigh the match outcomes accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in Blood Bowl data analysis, it seems that a 2:1:0 (W / D / L) weighting scheme is most commonly used. \n",
    "This scheme has the advantage that the weighted average win percentage over all matches is always 50%, creating a nice reference point allowing conclusions such as this and that team has an x percent above average win percentage.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, Mike Davies from the NAF calculates win rate by weighting each win as 1 point, and each draw as 0.5 points (For example, [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/mike.sann0638.davies/viz/NAFGames_0/SuccessBB2020)).\n",
