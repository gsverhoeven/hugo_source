In this post, we'll explore the `BupaR` suite of *Process Mining* packages created by *Gert Janssenswillen* from Hasselt University.


We start with exploring the `patients` dataset contained in the `eventdataR` package. According to the documentation, this is an "Artifical eventlog about patients".

# Getting started

After installing all required packages, we can load the whole "bupaverse" by loading the `bupaR` package.

```{r warnings = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(bupaR)
#library(eventdataR)

df <- eventdataR::patients
```

The data is already in `event log` format, let's check it out.

```{r}
summary(df)
```
So we learn that there are 500 "cases", i.e. patients. There are 7 different activities. 

Let's check out the data for a single patient:

```{r}
df %>% filter(patient == 1) %>% 
  arrange(handling_id) #%>% 
 # select(handling, handling_id, registration_type) # does not work
```
We learn that each "handling" has a separate start and complete timestamp.

# Traces

The summary info of the event log also counts so-called "traces". A trace is defined a unique sequence of events in the event log. Apparently, there are only seven different traces (possible sequences). Let's visualize them.

To visualize all traces, we set `coverage` to 1.0.

```{r}
df %>% trace_explorer(type = "frequent", coverage = 1.0)
```
So there are a few traces (0.6%) that do not end with a check-out.
Ignoring these rare cases, we find that there are two types of cases:

* Cases that get an X-ray
* Cases that get a blood test followed by an MRI scan

# The dotted chart

A really powerful visualization in process mining comes in the form of a "dotted chart". The dotted chart function produces a `ggplot` graph, which is nice, because so we can actually tweak the graph as we can with regular ggplot objects.

```{r}
df %>% dotted_chart(x = "relative", sort = "duration") + ggtitle("All cases") +
  theme_gray()
```

A nice pattern emerges, where all cases start with registration, then quickly proceed to triage and assessment, after that, a time varying period of 1-10 days follows where either the blood test + MRI scan, or the X-ray is performed, followed by discussing the results. Finally, check out occurs.
