In this post, we'll explore the BupaR suite of Process Mining packages created by Jan Wijffels.
After installing all required packages, we can load the whole "bupaverse" by loading the `bupaR` package.

We start with exploring the `patients` dataset contained in the `eventdataR` package.

```{r warnings = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(bupaR)

df <- eventdataR::patients
```

```{r}
str(df)
```
