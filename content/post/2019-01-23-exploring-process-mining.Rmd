In this post, we'll explore the [BupaR](https://www.bupar.net) suite of *Process Mining* packages created by *Gert Janssenswillen* from Hasselt University.


We start with exploring the `patients` dataset contained in the `eventdataR` package. According to the documentation, this is an "Artifical eventlog about patients".

# Getting started

After installing all required packages, we can load the whole "bupaverse" by loading the `bupaR` package.

```{r warnings = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(bupaR)
library(processmapR)
```

Now, our dataset is already in `eventlog` format, but typically this not the case.
Here's how to turn a data.frame into an object of class `eventlog`:

```{r}
patients <- eventdataR::patients

df <- eventlog(patients,
               case_id = "patient",
               activity_id = "handling",
               activity_instance_id = "handling_id",
               lifecycle_id = "registration_type",
               timestamp = "time",
               resource_id = "employee")
```



Let's check it out.

```{r}
summary(df)
```
So we learn that there are 500 "cases", i.e. patients. There are 7 different activities. 

Let's check out the data for a single patient:

```{r}
df %>% filter(patient == 1) %>% 
  arrange(handling_id) #%>% 
 # select(handling, handling_id, registration_type) # does not work
```
We learn that each "handling" has a separate start and complete timestamp.

# Traces

The summary info of the event log also counts so-called "traces". A trace is defined a unique sequence of events in the event log. Apparently, there are only seven different traces (possible sequences). Let's visualize them.

To visualize all traces, we set `coverage` to 1.0.

```{r}
df %>% processmapR::trace_explorer(type = "frequent", coverage = 1.0)
```
So there are a few traces (0.6%) that do not end with a check-out.
Ignoring these rare cases, we find that there are two types of cases:

* Cases that get an X-ray
* Cases that get a blood test followed by an MRI scan

# The dotted chart

A really powerful visualization in process mining comes in the form of a "dotted chart". The dotted chart function produces a `ggplot` graph, which is nice, because so we can actually tweak the graph as we can with regular ggplot objects.

It has two nice use cases.
The first is when we plot actual time on the x-axis, and sort the cases by starting date.

```{r}
df %>% dotted_chart(x = "absolute", sort = "start") + ggtitle("All cases") +
  theme_gray()
```

The slope of this graphs learns us the rate of new cases, and if this changes over time. Here it appears constant, with 500 cases divided over five quarter years.

The second is to align all cases relative to the first event, and sort on duration of the whole sequence of events.

```{r}
df %>% dotted_chart(x = "relative", sort = "duration") + ggtitle("All cases") +
  theme_gray()
```

A nice pattern emerges, where all cases start with registration, then quickly proceed to triage and assessment, after that, a time varying period of 1-10 days follows where either the blood test + MRI scan, or the X-ray is performed, followed by discussing the results. Finally, check out occurs.


# Conclusion

To conclude, the process mining approach to analyze time series event data appears highly promising. The dotted chart is a great addition to my data visualization repertoire, and the process mining folks appear to have at lot more goodies, such as Trace Alignment.
