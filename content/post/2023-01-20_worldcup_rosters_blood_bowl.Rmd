# Read and prep the data

We start with reading in the scraped FUMBBL match data, see my previous blog posts mentioned above for details.

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(ggfortify)
library(ggrepel)
```

```{r}
df_matches <- read.csv(file = "../../../fumbbl_datasets/datasets/current/df_matches.csv")

df_matches$match_date <- as.Date(df_matches$match_date)
df_matches$week_date <- as.Date(df_matches$week_date)


df_mbt <- read.csv(file = "../../../fumbbl_datasets/datasets/current/df_mbt.csv")

df_mbt$match_date <- as.Date(df_mbt$match_date)
df_mbt$week_date <- as.Date(df_mbt$week_date)

```

```{r}
df_mbt %>%
  filter(division_name == "Competitive") %>%
 group_by(race_name, race_type) %>%
 summarise(n_mbt = n()) %>%
  arrange(-n_mbt)
```

```{r}
res <- df_matches %>%
  #filter(division_name == "Competitive") %>%
  group_by(week_date, division_name, tournament_id) %>%
  summarise(cnt = n())

ggplot(res , aes(x = week_date, y = cnt, col = division_name)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
    theme(legend.position = "none") 
```
```{r}
# tournament id under competitive??
# Royal Rookie Rumble 491, onder groep 2294

# All New (meaning 0 Games) [Competitive] teams are eligible to apply. Your team will be accepted when there are 16 teams ready to rumble.
# Teams will be chosen on a "first come first serve" basis.
# Applied Teams which were not drawn in the last Tourney stay applied and need not to be reapplied. Your team will eventually be drawn in a RRR as long as it has 0 games played and has applied.


df_matches %>% filter(tournament_id == 56069)
```
```{r}
res <- df_matches %>%
  filter(league == 9298) %>%
  group_by(division_name, tournament_id, division_id, league, ruleset) %>%
  summarise(cnt = n(), start_date = min(match_date), end_date = max(match_date)) %>%
  arrange(-tournament_id)

res
```

# Teams selection: identify 1150K tournaments

```{r}
df_matches$tv_1150 <- 0

df_matches[df_matches$tv_match == 1150, ]$tv_1150 <- 1
```

```{r}
df_matches %>%
  group_by(division_name, tournament_id, division_id, league, ruleset, tournament_name) %>%
  summarise(cnt = n(), 
            perc = mean(tv_1150),
            start_date = min(match_date), 
            end_date = max(match_date)) %>%
  filter(perc > 0.7) %>%
  mutate(full_name = paste(division_name, " --", tournament_name)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(full_name, tournament_id, league, perc, cnt, start_date, end_date) %>%
  arrange(-cnt)
```

This looks good. "German Eurobowl team" has become "World cup training".


# Teams selection: identify 1100K tournaments

```{r}
df_matches$tv_1100 <- 0

df_matches[df_matches$tv_match == 1100, ]$tv_1100 <- 1
```

```{r}
df_matches %>%
  group_by(division_name, tournament_id, division_id, league, ruleset, tournament_name, year) %>%
  summarise(cnt = n(), 
            perc = mean(tv_1100),
            start_date = min(match_date), 
            end_date = max(match_date)) %>%
  filter(perc > 0.7) %>%
  mutate(full_name = paste(division_name, " --", tournament_name)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(full_name, tournament_id, league, perc, cnt, start_date, end_date) %>%
  arrange(-cnt)
```

# Check Alicante world cup training teams

```{r}
res <- df_matches %>% filter(league == 9941 & year > 2021) %>% group_by(week_date, year) %>% summarise(n(), avg_team = mean(team1_id), var_team = sd(team1_id))

ggplot(res, aes(x = week_date, y = avg_team)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_point(aes(y = var_team*100), col = "red")
```
```{r}
max(unique(c(df_matches %>% filter(league == 9941 & week_date == as.Date("2022-11-21")) %>%
  pull(team1_id), df_matches %>% filter(league == 9941 & week_date == as.Date("2022-11-21")) %>%
  pull(team2_id))))
```
Conclusion not enough WC teams to analyse, we analyse EB instead.
