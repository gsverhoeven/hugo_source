# outline

Introduce competitive blood bowl.
Make comparison with MtG deck building, and the "meta".

# Tournament selection

```{r}
# Load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(ggfortify)
library(ggrepel)
```

```{r}
df_matches <- read.csv(file = "../../../fumbbl_datasets/datasets/current/df_matches.csv")

df_matches$match_date <- as.Date(df_matches$match_date)
df_matches$week_date <- as.Date(df_matches$week_date)


df_mbt <- read.csv(file = "../../../fumbbl_datasets/datasets/current/df_mbt.csv")

df_mbt$match_date <- as.Date(df_mbt$match_date)
df_mbt$week_date <- as.Date(df_mbt$week_date)

```

```{r}
df_mbt %>%
  filter(division_name == "Competitive") %>%
 group_by(race_name, race_type) %>%
 summarise(n_mbt = n()) %>%
  arrange(-n_mbt)
```

```{r}
res <- df_matches %>%
  filter(year >= 2022) %>%
  group_by(division_name, league, division_id, tournament_id) %>%
  summarise(cnt = n()) %>%
  arrange(-cnt)

res
```
```{r}
# tournament id under competitive??
# Royal Rookie Rumble 491, onder groep 2294

# All New (meaning 0 Games) [Competitive] teams are eligible to apply. Your team will be accepted when there are 16 teams ready to rumble.
# Teams will be chosen on a "first come first serve" basis.
# Applied Teams which were not drawn in the last Tourney stay applied and need not to be reapplied. Your team will eventually be drawn in a RRR as long as it has 0 games played and has applied.


df_matches %>% filter(tournament_id == 56069)
```
```{r}
res <- df_matches %>%
  filter(league == 9298) %>%
  group_by(division_name, tournament_id, division_id, league, ruleset) %>%
  summarise(cnt = n(), start_date = min(match_date), end_date = max(match_date)) %>%
  arrange(-tournament_id)

res
```

# Teams selection: identify 1150K tournaments

```{r}
df_matches$tv_1150 <- 0

df_matches[df_matches$tv_match == 1150, ]$tv_1150 <- 1
```

```{r}
df_matches %>%
  group_by(division_name, tournament_id, division_id, league, ruleset, tournament_name) %>%
  summarise(cnt = n(), 
            perc = mean(tv_1150),
            start_date = min(match_date), 
            end_date = max(match_date)) %>%
  filter(perc > 0.7) %>%
  mutate(full_name = paste(division_name, " --", tournament_name)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(full_name, tournament_id, league, perc, cnt, start_date, end_date) %>%
  arrange(-cnt)
```

This looks good. "German Eurobowl team" has become "World cup training".


# Teams selection: identify 1100K tournaments

```{r}
df_matches$tv_1100 <- 0

df_matches[df_matches$tv_match == 1100, ]$tv_1100 <- 1
```

```{r}
df_matches %>%
  group_by(division_name, tournament_id, division_id, league, ruleset, tournament_name, year) %>%
  summarise(cnt = n(), 
            perc = mean(tv_1100),
            start_date = min(match_date), 
            end_date = max(match_date)) %>%
  filter(perc > 0.7) %>%
  mutate(full_name = paste(division_name, " --", tournament_name)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(full_name, tournament_id, league, perc, cnt, start_date, end_date) %>%
  arrange(-cnt)
```

# Check Alicante world cup training teams

```{r}
res <- df_matches %>% filter(league == 9941 & year > 2021) %>% group_by(week_date, year) %>% summarise(n(), avg_team = mean(team1_id), var_team = sd(team1_id))

ggplot(res, aes(x = week_date, y = avg_team)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_point(aes(y = var_team*100), col = "red")
```
```{r}
max(unique(c(df_matches %>% filter(league == 9941 & week_date == as.Date("2022-11-21")) %>%
  pull(team1_id), df_matches %>% filter(league == 9941 & week_date == as.Date("2022-11-21")) %>%
  pull(team2_id))))
```
Conclusion not enough WC teams to analyse, we analyse EB instead.

Super league has 400+ matches, try that one
league is 15615



```{r}
res <- df_matches %>%
  filter(league == 15615 & year > 2021) %>%
  group_by(division_name, league, division_id, tournament_id) %>%
  summarise(cnt = n()) %>%
  arrange(-cnt)

res
```


Of world cup training (bevat vooral EB teams, kunnen filteren op team value) of op datum oid.
Is ergens in november geswitched. Heel 2022 was het EB training. Moeten even kijken naar # skills.
