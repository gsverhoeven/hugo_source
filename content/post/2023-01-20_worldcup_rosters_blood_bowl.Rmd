# outline

Yet another Blood Bowl post! This one is on the upcoming World Cup, analyzing variation in Roster choices by top coaches. For the uninitiated: In my spare time I like to play Blood Bowl, a chess-like Board game where two teams play a match of fantasy football. It is set in the Warhammer universe, with teams populated by Orcs, goblins, Elves etc. See my previous blog posts on Blood Bowl for more background and stats.

So the cool thing of Blood Bowl is that it has a highly competitive Tournament scene. With the ultimate tournament of course being the World Cup! The Previous World Cup was held in 2019 in Dornbirn, Austria, and attracted 1400 coaches. This year the World Cup is hosted by Spain, and at least as many coaches are expected in Alicante to battle it out.

Blood Bowl tournaments typically come with a "Rule pack". This describes which teams (see [this post](cluster_post)) are allowed, how much gold coaches have to buy players, and how much skills can be allotted to players to improve their ball handling, or ability to knock other players down.

Bad choices in this phase will put you at a disadvantage even before the actual game has started.
Just as in other popular games with pre-game deck building, like Magic The Gathering, this automatically leads to a Meta game, where one has to prepare for choices that other coaches make. 

# Online Blood Bowl Tournaments on FUMBBL

As described in [this post](fumbbl scraping), Blood Bowl can also be played online. Here we focus on FUMBBL, a Java app linked to a website that performs match making, calculates rankings, provides a forum for discussions etc. There are many things great with respect to FUMBBL. Here I like to mention the fact that it has an API where we can fetch data, AND it stores full replays of all FUMBBL matches. 
This allows us to spectate particular matches and learn how a particular roster works out in practice.


# Tournament selection

I found two FUMBBL resurrection tournaments using BB2020 rules that have sufficient volume AND have the chosen skills available (the first NAF online tournament GBFU using BB2020 rules somehow does not have this).

* Road to Malta
* Superleague

For preparation for the WC, the Road to Malta is the best, as its ruleset is almost identical to the WC (Except for tiering changes and PM). The superleague does not allow stars, making a big difference for e.g. Halfing, Underworld and OWA that competitively are typically played with Star players.

```{r}
# Load packages
library(tidyverse)
#library(ggfortify)
library(ggrepel)
```

```{r}
df_matches <- read.csv(file = "../../../fumbbl_datasets/datasets/current/df_matches.csv")

df_matches$match_date <- as.Date(df_matches$match_date)
df_matches$week_date <- as.Date(df_matches$week_date)


df_mbt <- read.csv(file = "../../../fumbbl_datasets/datasets/current/df_mbt.csv")

df_mbt$match_date <- as.Date(df_mbt$match_date)
df_mbt$week_date <- as.Date(df_mbt$week_date)

```

```{r}
df_mbt %>%
  filter(division_name == "Competitive") %>%
 group_by(race_name, race_type) %>%
 summarise(n_mbt = n()) %>%
  arrange(-n_mbt)
```

```{r}
res <- df_matches %>%
  filter(year >= 2022) %>%
  group_by(division_name, league, division_id, tournament_id) %>%
  summarise(cnt = n()) %>%
  arrange(-cnt)

res
```
```{r}
# tournament id under competitive??
# Royal Rookie Rumble 491, onder groep 2294

# All New (meaning 0 Games) [Competitive] teams are eligible to apply. Your team will be accepted when there are 16 teams ready to rumble.
# Teams will be chosen on a "first come first serve" basis.
# Applied Teams which were not drawn in the last Tourney stay applied and need not to be reapplied. Your team will eventually be drawn in a RRR as long as it has 0 games played and has applied.


df_matches %>% filter(tournament_id == 56069)
```
```{r}
res <- df_matches %>%
  filter(league == 9298) %>%
  group_by(division_name, tournament_id, division_id, league, ruleset) %>%
  summarise(cnt = n(), start_date = min(match_date), end_date = max(match_date)) %>%
  arrange(-tournament_id)

res
```

# Teams selection: identify 1150K tournaments

```{r}
df_matches$tv_1150 <- 0

df_matches[df_matches$tv_match == 1150, ]$tv_1150 <- 1
```

```{r}
df_matches %>%
  group_by(division_name, tournament_id, division_id, league, ruleset, tournament_name) %>%
  summarise(cnt = n(), 
            perc = mean(tv_1150),
            start_date = min(match_date), 
            end_date = max(match_date)) %>%
  filter(perc > 0.7) %>%
  mutate(full_name = paste(division_name, " --", tournament_name)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(full_name, tournament_id, league, perc, cnt, start_date, end_date) %>%
  arrange(-cnt)
```

This looks good. "German Eurobowl team" has become "World cup training".


# Teams selection: identify 1100K tournaments

```{r}
df_matches$tv_1100 <- 0

df_matches[df_matches$tv_match == 1100, ]$tv_1100 <- 1
```

```{r}
df_matches %>%
  group_by(division_name, tournament_id, division_id, league, ruleset, tournament_name, year) %>%
  summarise(cnt = n(), 
            perc = mean(tv_1100),
            start_date = min(match_date), 
            end_date = max(match_date)) %>%
  filter(perc > 0.7) %>%
  mutate(full_name = paste(division_name, " --", tournament_name)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(full_name, tournament_id, league, perc, cnt, start_date, end_date) %>%
  arrange(-cnt)
```

# Check Alicante world cup training teams

```{r}
res <- df_matches %>% filter(league == 9941 & year > 2021) %>% group_by(week_date, year) %>% summarise(n(), avg_team = mean(team1_id), var_team = sd(team1_id))

ggplot(res, aes(x = week_date, y = avg_team)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_point(aes(y = var_team*100), col = "red")
```
```{r}
max(unique(c(df_matches %>% filter(league == 9941 & week_date == as.Date("2022-11-21")) %>%
  pull(team1_id), df_matches %>% filter(league == 9941 & week_date == as.Date("2022-11-21")) %>%
  pull(team2_id))))
```
Conclusion not enough WC teams to analyse, we analyse EB instead.

Super league has 400+ matches, try that one
league is 15615



```{r}
res <- df_matches %>%
  filter(league == 15615 & year > 2021) %>%
  group_by(division_name, league, division_id, tournament_id) %>%
  summarise(cnt = n()) %>%
  arrange(-cnt)

res
```


Of world cup training (bevat vooral EB teams, kunnen filteren op team value) of op datum oid.
Is ergens in november geswitched. Heel 2022 was het EB training. Moeten even kijken naar # skills.
