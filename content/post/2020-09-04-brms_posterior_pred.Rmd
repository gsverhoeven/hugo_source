# Introduction

Suppose we have data from a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) and we want to estimate the average treatment effect (ATE). 
Patients get treated, or not, depending only on a coin flip. This is encoded in the `Treatment` variable.
The outcome is a count variable `Admissions`, representing the number of times the patient gets admitted to the hospital.
The treatment is expected to reduce the number of hospital admissions for patients.

To complicate matters (a bit): As is often the case with patients, not all patients are identical :)
Suppose that older patients have on average more Admissions. So `Age` is a covariate.

# Average treatment effect (ATE)

Now, after we fitted a model to the data, we want to actually **use** our model to answer "What-if" questions (counterfactuals).
Here we answer the following question: 

* What would the average reduction in Admissions be if we had treated **ALL** the patients in the sample, compared to a situation where **NO** patient in the sample would have received treatment?

Well, that is easy, we just take the fitted model, change treatment from zero to one for each, and observe the ("marginal") effect on the outcome, right?

Yes, but the uncertainty is harder. We have uncertainty in the estimated coefficients of the intercept and covariate, as well us in the treatment variable. And these uncertainties can be correlated (for example between the coefficients of intercept and covariate).

Here we show how to use `posterior_predict()` to simulate outcomes of the model using the sampled parameters.
If we do this for two counterfactuals, all patients treated, and all patients untreated, and subtract these, we can easily calculate the posterior predictive distribution of the average treatment effect.

Let's do it!

# Packages used

This tutorial uses [brms](https://github.com/paul-buerkner/brms), a user friendly interface to full Bayesian modelling with [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/.

```{r, message = TRUE, warning = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
library(rstan)
library(brms) 
```

# Data simulation

We generate fake data that matches our problem setup.

`Admissions` are determined by patient `Age`, whether the patient has `Treatment`, and some random `Noise` to capture unobserved effects that influence `Admissions`. We exponentiate them to always get a positive number, and plug it in the Poisson distribution using `rpois()`.

```{r}
set.seed(123) 

id <- 1:200   
n_obs <- length(id)
b_tr <- -0.7
b_age <- 0.1

df_sim <- as.data.frame(id) %>% 
mutate(Age = rgamma(n_obs, shape = 5, scale = 2)) %>% # positive cont predictor
mutate(Noise = rnorm(n_obs, mean = 0, sd = 0.5)) %>% # add noise
mutate(Treatment = ifelse(runif(n_obs) < 0.5, 0, 1)) %>% # Flip a coin for treatment
mutate(Lambda = exp(b_age * Age + b_tr * Treatment + Noise)) %>% # generate lambda for the poisson dist
mutate(Admissions = rpois(n_obs, lambda = Lambda))

```


# Summarize data

Ok, so what does our dataset look like?

```{r}
summary(df_sim)
```

The Treatment variable should reduce admissions.
Lets visualize the distribution of Admission values for both treated and untreated patients:

```{r, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = df_sim, aes(x = Admissions)) +
  geom_histogram(stat="count") +
  facet_wrap(~ Treatment) + 
  theme_bw()
```

The effect of the treatment on reducing admissions is clearly visible. Now lets fit our Bayesian Poisson regression model to it.

# Fit model

We use `brms` default priors for convenience here. For a real application we would of course put effort into into crafting priors that reflect our current knowledge of the problem at hand.

```{r}
model1 <- brm(
  formula = as.integer(Admissions) ~  Age + Treatment,
   data = df_sim,
  family = poisson(),
  warmup = 2000, iter = 5000, 
  cores = 2, 
  chains = 4,
  seed = 123,
  silent = TRUE,
  refresh = 0,
)
```
# Check model fit

```{r}
summary(model1)
```

We see that the posterior dists for $\beta_{Age}$ and $\beta_{Treatment}$ cover the true values, so looking good.
To get a fuller glimpse into the (correlated) uncertainty of the model parameters we make a pairs plot:

```{r}
pairs(model1)
```

As expected, the coefficients $\beta_{Intercept}$ (added by `brms`) and $\beta_{Age}$ are highly correlated.

# First attempt: Calculate Individual Treatment effects using the model fit object

We can calculate for each patient an individual treatment effect using the estimated model parameters.

```{r warnings = FALSE, message= FALSE}
est_intercept <- fixef(model1, pars = "Intercept")[,1]
est_age_eff <- fixef(model1, pars = "Age")[,1]
est_t <- fixef(model1, pars = "Treatment")[,1]

# brm fit parameters (intercept plus treatment)
ites <- exp(est_intercept + (est_age_eff * df_sim$Age) +  est_t) - exp(est_intercept + (est_age_eff * df_sim$Age))

ggplot(data.frame(ites), aes(x = ites)) + 
  geom_histogram() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(ites), col = "red") +
  ggtitle("Effect of treatment on Admissions for each observation")
```

Averaging the ITEs gives us the ATE, displayed in red. 

Ok, so **on average**, our treatment reduces the number of Admissions by -1.9. 

Above, we extracted the coefficients from the model fit and calculate the ITEs manually to expose the mechanism.
We could also have used  the `brms::predict()` function, with the same result.

You may wonder: why do we even have a distribution of treatment effects here? Should it not be the same for each patient?
Here a peculiarity of the Poisson regression model comes to surface: 
The effect of changing `Treatment` from 0 to 1 on the outcome depends on the value of `Age` of the patient.
This is because we **exponentiate** the linear model before we plug it into the Poisson distribution.

# Next, the uncertainty in the ATE

How to get all this underlying, correlated uncertainty in the model parameters, that have varying effects depending on the covariates of patients, and properly propagate that to the ATE? What is the range of plausible values of the ATE consistent with the data & model?

At this point, using only the summary statistics of the model fit (i.e. the coefficients), we hit a wall.
To make progress we have to work with the full posterior distribution of model parameters, and use this to make predictions.
That is why it is often called "the posterior predictive distribution" (Check [BDA3](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/BDA3.pdf) for the full story).

# Posterior predictive distribution (PPD): two tricks

Ok, you say, a Posterior Predictive Distribution, let's have it! Where can I get one?

Luckily for us, most of the work is already done, because we have fitted our model.
And thus we have a large collection of parameter draws (or samples, to confuse things a bit). All the correlated uncertainty is contained in these draws.

This is the first trick. Conceptually, we imagine that each separate draw of the posterior represents a particular version of our model. 

In our example model fit, we have 12.000 samples from the posterior. In our imagination, we now have 12.000 versions of our model, where unlikely parameter combinations are present less often compared to likely parameter combinations. The full uncertainty of our model parameters is contained in this "collection of models" . 

The second trick is that we simulate (generate) predictions for all observations, from each of these 12.000 models.
Under the hood, this means computing for each model (we have 12.000), for each observation (we have 200) the predicted lambda value given the covariates, and drawing a single value from a Poisson distribution with that $\Lambda$ value (e.g. running `rpois(n = 1, lambda)` ).

This gives us a 12.000 x 200 matrix, that we can compute with.

# Computing with the PPD: brms::posterior_predict()

To compute PPD's, we can use `brms::posterior_predict()`. This is basically just `brms::predict(summary = FALSE)`.
We can feed it any dataset using the `newdata` argument, and have it generate a PPD.

For our application, the computation can be broken down in two steps: 

*    Step 1: use `posterior_predict()` on our dataset with `Treatment` set to zero, do the same for our dataset with `Treatment` set to one, and subtract the two matrices. This gives us a matrix of outcome differences / treatment effects.
*    Step 2: Averaging over all cols (the N=200 simulated outcomes for each draw) should give us the distribution of the ATE.
This distribution now represents the variability (uncertainty) of the estimate.

Ok, step 1:

```{r}
# create two versions of our dataset, with all Tr= 0 and all Tr=1
df_sim_t0 <- df_sim %>% mutate(Treatment = 0)

df_sim_t1 <- df_sim %>% mutate(Treatment = 1)

# simulate the PPDs
pp_t0 <- posterior_predict(model1, newdata = df_sim_t0)

pp_t1 <- posterior_predict(model1, newdata = df_sim_t1)

diff <- pp_t1 - pp_t0

dim(diff)
```

And step 2 (averaging over the cols):

```{r}
ATE_per_draw <- apply(diff, 1, mean)

length(ATE_per_draw)
```

Finally, a distribution of plausible ATE values. Oo, that is so nice. Lets visualize it!

```{r, message=FALSE}
ggplot(data.frame(ATE_per_draw), aes(x = ATE_per_draw)) +
  geom_histogram() + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(ites), col = "red") +
  ggtitle("Posterior distribution of the Average Treatment Effect (ATE)")
```

We can compare this distribution with the point estimate of the ATE we obtained above using the model coefficients.
It sits right in the middle, just as it should be!

# Take home message: PPD with brms rocks

I hope to have demonstrated that when doing a full bayesian analysis with `brms` and `Stan`, it is very easy to create Posterior Predictive Distributions. And that if we *have* the posterior predictive distribution, incorporating uncertainty in various "marginal effects" type analyses becomes dead-easy. These analyses include what-if scenarios using the original data, or scenarios using new data with different covariate distributions (for example if we have an RCT that is enriched in young students, and we want to apply it to the general population).
Ok, that it is for today, happy modelling!
