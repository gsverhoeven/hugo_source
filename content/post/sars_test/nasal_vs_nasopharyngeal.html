<h2>Sample size required to detect a difference between 0.8 and 0.9 probability?</h2>
<p>But what about statistical power? From glancing at the literature (N = 40 also low power) the difference seems about 5- 10%.</p>
<p>How big a sample do we we need to detect a difference of 10%?</p>
<p>We can do a simple simulation to check the range of outcomes if we would compare two antigen tests, one with a sensitivity of 80%, and the other with a sensitivity of 90%, and a sample size of 40 pairs (so all 40 PCR positive, and then comparing both Ag tests):</p>
<pre class="r"><code>n_iter &lt;- 10000
n_sample &lt;- 40
probs &lt;- c(0.80, 0.90)

vec1 &lt;- rbinom(n_iter, n_sample, probs[1])
vec2 &lt;- rbinom(n_iter, n_sample, probs[2])

hist((vec1 - vec2)/n_sample)</code></pre>

We can see that the difference in sensitivity is highly uncertain, and in 0.1302 of the cases is the sign reversed, and the test with the lower sensitivity scores better!
So with these sample sizes, common statistical testing will likely yield a result of hypothesis of no difference not rejected.
We can see that papers use this to suggest that both swab methods give “similar” or “comparable” results.</p>

<h1>Mini literature review</h1>
<p>A quick google scholar search turned up several studies that claim to show no difference or “similar” performance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Irving et al 2012: Comparison of Nasal and Nasopharyngeal Swabs for Influenza Detection in Adults (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3494547/" class="uri">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3494547/</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Paired samples were collected from 240 adults; 33 (14%) individuals tested positive for influenza by rRT-PCR. Using rRT-PCR, the sensitivity of the nasal swab was 89% (95% CI, 78%-99%) and the sensitivity of the nasopharyngeal swab was 94% (95% CI, 87%-100%), compared to a composite gold standard.</p>
<p>Test sensitivity did not vary significantly by swab type when using a highly sensitive molecular diagnostic test, but power was limited to detect modest differences.</p>
<ul>
<li>Péré et al 2020: Nasal Swab Sampling for SARS-CoV-2: a Convenient Alternative in Times of Nasopharyngeal Swab Shortage (<a href="https://jcm.asm.org/content/58/6/e00721-20" class="uri">https://jcm.asm.org/content/58/6/e00721-20</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Out of 37 patients that were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal swab testing, 33 also tested positive by nasal sampling.</p>
<p>We herein report that the molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 using nasal swab specimens was nearly equivalent to the detection using nasopharyngeal swab considered the gold standard. (<strong>This one is really bad</strong>)</p>
<ul>
<li>Head-to-head comparison of SARS-CoV-2 antigen-detecting rapid test with self-collected nasal swab versus professional-collected nasopharyngeal swab</li>
</ul>
<p>The STANDARD Q Ag-RDT with NMT sampling showed a sensitivity of 74.4% (29/39 PCR positives detected; 95% CI 58.9–85.4%) and specificity of 99.2% (95% CI 97.1–99.8%) compared to RT-PCR. The sensitivity with NP sampling was 79.5% (31/39 PCR positives detected; 95% CI 64.5–89.2%) and specificity was 99.6% (95% CI 97.8–100%).</p>
<p>And from the press release: “This study shows that supervised, self-administered swabs are no less effective than professional-collected nasopharyngeal swabs when used with the antigen test selected for this research,” explains PD Dr. Denkinger.(Brrr)</p>
<ul>
<li>Seaman et al 2019: Self-collected compared with professional-collected swabbing in the diagnosis of influenza in symptomatic individuals: A meta-analysis and assessment of validity</li>
</ul>
<p>Pooled sensitivity was 87% (95%CI:80%,92%) and specificity was 99% (95%CI:98%,100%), compared to professional-collected swabs in the diagnosis of influenza.</p>
<p>Great, somebody did a meta-analysis!</p>
<ul>
<li>Lee et al 2021: Performance of Saliva, Oropharyngeal Swabs, and Nasal Swabs for SARS-CoV-2 Molecular Detection: a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis</li>
</ul>
<p>While all 3 sample types independently seemed to capture lower % positives (nasal swabs 82% [95% CI 73 to 90%], OP swabs 84% [95% CI 57 to 100%] and saliva 88%[95% CI 81 to 93%]) in comparison to NP swabs, combined OP/nasal swabs in 4 studies,interestingly, had the same % positive detection rate as NP swabs (97% [95% CI 90 to100%]) (Fig. 6).</p>
