<p><em>This blog post uses the <code>fumbbl_replays</code> Python package.</em>
<em>To install the <code>fumbbl_replays</code> python package, follow the instructions at the <a href="https://github.com/gsverhoeven/fumbbl_replays">fumbbl_replays Github repository</a>.</em></p>
<p>This analysis focuses on team development in League play.
Last season I played Gnomes in our local league (<a href="https://tourplay.net/en/blood-bowl/big-season-5/">B.I.G. league in Hilversum, Netherlands</a>), and was curious how to best develop the team.</p>
<p>So I did some data analysis.
On FUMBBL, a “meta competition” is organized called Black Box Trophy (BBT).
In the Black Box Trophy, teams start off with 1M gold, and play 15 matches against random opponents in the Black box division.
It uses the rule book team development rules (earning SPP, leveling up players etc).
When the meta-event ends (currently after 4 months), the best performing coaches are declared winner.</p>
<p>This appears to be a high stakes competitive BB League environment, perfect to learn what choices pro players make to optimally develop their teams.</p>
<p><strong>I decided to look at the top performing Gnome teams from the last three BBT seasons</strong>.</p>
<p>For this analysis, the starting point is the <code>team_id</code>.
This is part of the url of the team on FUMBBL: <a href="https://fumbbl.com/p/team?id=1177218" class="uri">https://fumbbl.com/p/team?id=1177218</a></p>
<p>These teams and their coaches stood out based on their win rates:</p>
<ul>
<li>BBT 11: “We do gnomes” by coach Elyod (10/2/3 WDL) (<a href="https://fumbbl.com/t/1177218" class="uri">https://fumbbl.com/t/1177218</a>)</li>
<li>BBT 11: “You’ve been tricked” by coach Heymaiya (8/3/4 WDL) (<a href="https://fumbbl.com/t/1175080" class="uri">https://fumbbl.com/t/1175080</a>)</li>
<li>BBT 12: “Lawn Bullies” by coach Candlejack (10/4/1 WDL) (<a href="https://fumbbl.com/t/1193897" class="uri">https://fumbbl.com/t/1193897</a>)</li>
<li>BBT 13: “Gnom Gnom” by coach Norn (9/5/1 WDL) (<a href="https://fumbbl.com/t/1211512" class="uri">https://fumbbl.com/t/1211512</a>)</li>
<li>BBT 13: “Vengeance Most fowl” by coach Heymaiya (10/1/4 WDL) (<a href="https://fumbbl.com/t/1210291" class="uri">https://fumbbl.com/t/1210291</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>I wrote a function <code>fetch_team_development_data(team_id)</code> to fetch the rosters from the first 15 replays for each team.
We can then plot this data to track the team development using the function <code>make_team_development_plot()</code>.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>import fumbbl_replays as fb

team_ids = [1177218, 1175080, 1193897, 1211512, 1210291]

for team_id in team_ids:
    res = fb.fetch_team_development_data(team_id)
    fb.make_team_development_plot(res)</code></pre>

<div id="what-can-we-learn-from-how-these-gnome-teams-developed" class="section level1">
<h1>What can we learn from how these Gnome teams developed?</h1>
<p>What starting roster is used?
How are the SPP spent? What player builds do we see?</p>
<div id="starting-roster" class="section level2">
<h2>Starting roster</h2>
<p>The Gnome roster including skill access and player cost can be found at the <a href="https://bbtactics.com/gnome-teams/">Blood Bowl Tactics website</a>.
As a starting roster, all five rosters start with 6 linemen and all positionals, for 14 players.
Variation is in number of rerolls (Three or four), and having an Apothecary (yes or no).</p>
</div>
<div id="foxes" class="section level2">
<h2>Foxes</h2>
<p>Foxes are the stars of the team, collecting SPP by scoring TDs.
<strong>+MA</strong> is by far the most popular. <strong>Sure feet</strong> is also an option, to save on rerolls for the GFIs.</p>
</div>
<div id="treemen" class="section level2">
<h2>Treemen</h2>
<p>Treemen skill up quickly by all those 3-die block casualties and the occassional superb TTM.
<strong>Guard</strong> is favorite. Less common options are <strong>+MA</strong>, <strong>Pro</strong> and <strong>Defensive</strong>.
Candlejack managed to get a second skill on both after 12 and 14 games, <strong>+MA</strong> and <strong>Block</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Defensive</strong> was a surprise for me. It turns off <strong>Guard</strong> during the opponents turn.
It makes it more difficult for opponents to bring in enough assists to knock down the tree.
This is strong when the trees form part of the cage formation, in combination with Beastmasters closeby that come with <strong>Guard</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div id="linemen" class="section level2">
<h2>Linemen</h2>
<p>For linemen, we see mostly saving up (MVP, TTM TDs?) for <strong>Dodge</strong>. There is one lineman with a second skill, <strong>diving tackle</strong>, to serve as a marking player.
Overall, it appears difficult to skill up linemen, since they do not live long enough.
Of the 6 linemen in the starting roster, without <strong>Dodge</strong> only 1 or 2 survive after 15 games.</p>
</div>
<div id="illusionists" class="section level2">
<h2>Illusionists</h2>
<p>Same as the line gnomes, lifespan issues. After they gain <strong>Dodge</strong> protection, <strong>Leader</strong> for an extra reroll.
Coach Elyod randomed pass skills, possibly in search of a cheap leader skill.</p>
</div>
<div id="beastmasters" class="section level2">
<h2>Beastmasters</h2>
<p>Beastmasters have higher AV than the rest of the gnomes, but are more often where the action is, using their guard to assist in blocks, or protecting the ball carrier.
So as with the other gnomes, they want <strong>Dodge</strong> first for more protection. After that <strong>Sidestep</strong>.</p>
<p>I had great fun painting up and playing Gnomes, so give em a try!</p>
