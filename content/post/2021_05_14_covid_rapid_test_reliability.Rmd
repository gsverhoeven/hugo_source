Many people are suspicious about the reliability of rapid self-tests, so I decided to check it out.
For starters, I LOVE measurement. It is where learning from data starts, with technology involved, and models. 
With this post, I'd like to join the swelling ranks of amateur epidemiologists :) I have spent a few years in a molecular biology lab, that should count for something right? 

At home, we now have a box of the `SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Test Nasal` kit.
The kit is distributed by Roche, but manufactured in South Korea by a company called SD Biosensor.
The leaflet contains information on the **sensitivity** (does it detect COVID when you are infected) and **specificity** of the test
(does it ONLY detect COVID, or also other flu types or even unrelated materials). 

These metrics are calculated from aggregated data gathered in three experiments on in total 547 persons. After googling a bit, I found out that the experiments were performed by independent researchers in a famous University hospital in Berlin, [Charité](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charit%C3%A9). After googling a bit more and mailing with one of the researchers involved, Prof. Andreas Lindner, I received a list of papers that describe the research mentioned in the leaflet.

# This blog post: PCR versus Antigen test

To do the PCR test you need a lab with PCR devices, pipets, and some time, as the process takes at least a few hours to complete.
The promise of antigen tests, such as the kit from Roche, is to have a low-tech, faster alternative.
But that comes at a cost, because the antigen tests are less sensitive.
How much less? To check this, we compare it to results from the **PCR test**.

The idea of this blog post is to cover all the steps in the chain of events that ultimately lead to the conclusion that a person is infected or not. 

* We start with the human body, that is infected and starts to build up virus particles, in the lungs, throat, nose etc.
* Then comes the step where we use a tool to take a **biological specimen** (a sample) that contains viral material.
* Then comes the device / procedure that detects the viral material and produces a signal that informs us on the presence of the COVID-19 virus in the sample.

# Viral load as target for measurement

Both the golden standaard, the PCR test, and the less sensitive Rapid Antigen test work by detecting viral particles in a particular sample. The amount of virus particles present in the sample depends on, for example:

* Time since infection
* How and where the sample is taken (throat, nose, lungs, using a swab etc)

## Time since infection

When you have just been infected, your body will contain only a small amount of virus.
It takes time for the virus to multiply itself. Even PCR cannot detect an infection on the first day, and even after 8 days, there are still some 20% of cases that go undetected by PCR (presumably because the amount of viral particle is too low).

The **viral load** is a function of time since infection. On the first day of the infection, because the viral load is so small, virtually none of all infections can be detected. Because the viral load increases, the detection percentage increases to ~50% after 5 days (typical first day of symptom onset), and to ~80% after 8 days, after which it decreases again to ~30% 21 days after infection. 

If you want to know more about the ability of PCR to detect COVID go check out [the covidRTPCR Github repository](https://github.com/HopkinsIDD/covidRTPCR). It is completely awesome, with open data, open code, and Bayesian statistics using [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/)!

## How and where the sample is taken

There are many ways to obtain a sample from a person.

Here the golden standard is a so-called **Nasopharyngeal swab**. This goes through your nose all the way (~ 5 cm) into the back of the throat, and is highly uncomfortable. Typically, only professional health workers perform *nasopharyngeal** swabs.

There are various alternatives: We have spit, saliva, we can cough up "sputum" (slime from the lungs) or we can take swab from the nose ("nasal") or from the throat ("oral"). 

The Roche antigen test is a **nasal** test that only goes up to 2 cm in the nose and can be used by patients themselves ("self-collected"). 

# The dataset: results from the three Berlin studies

The dataset for the blog post compares **nasal** samples tested with the Roche Antigen test kit, to PCR-tested **nasopharyngeal** samples taken by professionals. 

This blog post is possible because the three papers all contain the raw data as a table in the paper. Unfortunately, this means the data is not **machine readable**. However, with a combination of manual tweaking / find-replace and some coding, I tidied the data of the three studies into a single `tibble` data frame. You can grab the code and data from my [github](url_to_data).

The dataset `df_pcr_pos` contains, for each PCR positive patient:

* ct_value
* viral_load (through the calibration curve)
* days_of_symptoms
* mm_value (Result of the antigen test measurement)

First we focus on the PCR data.

The PCR test not only measures **if** someone is infected, it also provides an estimate of the viral load in the sample.
How does this work? PCR can amplify really low quantities of viral material in a biological sample. The amount of cycles of the PCR device needed to reach a threshold of signal is called the cycle threshold or **Ct value**. The less material we have in our sample, the more cycles we need to amplify the signal to reach a certain threshold. On the log scale, this gives us a linear inverse (negative) relationship between **ct_value** and **viral_load**. 

So let's plot the `ct_value` of the PCR test vs the viral load:

```{r}
set.seed(123)
ggplot(df_pcr_pos, aes(x = ct_value, y = viral_load, color = factor(pcr_assay_type))) + 
  geom_point() + ggtitle("Calibration curves for viral load (log10 scale)")

```
This plot shows that `viral_load` is directly derived from the `ct_value` through a multiplication factor.
PCR Ct values of > 35 are considered as the threshold value for detecting a COVID infection using the PCR test.

Take some time to appreciate the huge range difference in the samples on display here.
From only 10.000 viral particles ($log_{10}{(10^4)} = 4$ ) to almost 1 billion ($log_{10}{(10^9)} = 9$ ) particles.

We can also see that apparently, there were two separate PCR assays (test types), each with a separate conversion formula used to obtain the estimated viral load.

(**N.b.** The missings for `pcr_assay_type` are because for two of three datasets, it was difficult to extract this information from the PDF file. From the plot, we can conclude that for these datasets, the same two assays were used since the values map onto the same two calibration lines)

## Sensitivity of the Antigen test

The dataset contains all samples for which the PCR test was positive.
Let's start by checking the raw percentage of antigen test measurements that are positive as well. 
This is called the **sensitivity** of a test.

```{r}
res <- df_pcr_pos %>%
  summarize(sensitivity = mean(mm_value), 
            N = n())

res
```
So for all PCR positive samples, `r res$sensitivity * 100` % is positive as well.
This means that, on average, if we would use the antigen test kit, we have a one in five (20%) probability of not detecting COVID-19, compared to when we would have used the method used by test centers operated by the public health agencies.

Let's postpone evaluation of this fact for a moment and look a bit closer at the data.
For example, we can example the relationship between viral load and a positive antigen test result (`mm_value` = 1):

```{r}
set.seed(123)
ggplot(df_pcr_pos, aes(x = viral_load, y = mm_value)) + 
  geom_jitter(height = 0.1) +
  geom_smooth() + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = c(5.7, 7), col = "red")
```
From this plot, we can see that the probability of obtaining a False negative result (`mm_value` of 0) on the Antigen test decreases as the viral load *of the PCR sample* increases. From the data, it looks like for the antigen test starts to work about half of the time, we need around $5 \cdot 10^5$ viral particles (log10 scale 5.7), and for it to work reliably, we need around $10^7$ particles ("high" viral load) **in the location where the PCR sample was obtained**. This last bit is important: the researchers did not measure the viral load in the nasal swabs used for the antigen test, these could well be lower. 

For high viral loads, above $10^7$ particles in the NP/OP sample, the probability of a false negative result is only a few percent:

```{r}
df_pcr_pos %>% filter(viral_load >= 7) %>%
  summarize(sensitivity = mean(mm_value), 
            N = n())
```

# Viral loads varies with days of symptoms

Above, we already discussed that the viral load varies with the time since infection.

If we want to use the antigen test **INSTEAD** of taking a PCR test, we don't have information on the viral load. What we often do have is the days since symptoms, and we know that in the first few days of symptoms viral load is highest. 

We can check this by plotting the `days_of_symptoms` versus `viral_load`:

```{r}
ggplot(df_pcr_pos, aes(x = days_of_symptoms, y = viral_load)) + 
  geom_smooth() + expand_limits(x = -4) + geom_vline(xintercept = 1, linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = c(3, 7), col = "red") + geom_hline(yintercept = 7, col = "grey", linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_jitter(height = 0, width = 0.2) 

```
From this plot, we learn that the viral load is highest on the onset of symptoms day (typically 5 days after infection) and decreases afterwards. When evaluating rapid antigen tests, sometimes thresholds for days of symptoms are used, for example <= 3 days or <= 7 days (plotted in red). 

Let us see how sensitive the antigen test is for these subgroups:

```{r}
res <- df_pcr_pos %>%
  filter(days_of_symptoms <= 3) %>%
  summarize(label = "< 3 days",
            sensitivity = mean(mm_value), 
            N = n())

res2 <- df_pcr_pos %>%
  filter(days_of_symptoms <= 7) %>%
  summarize(label = "< 7 days",
            sensitivity = mean(mm_value), 
            N = n())

bind_rows(res, res2)
```
The sensitivity in both subgroups is increased to `r res$sensitivity * 100` % and `r res2$sensitivity * 100` %.
Now only 1 in 7 cases is missed by the antigen test. We return to this fact at the end of the blog.

# Specificity

So far, the discussion centered around the **sensitivity** of the test.
Equally important is the **specificity** of the test. This quantifies if the test result of the antigen test is specific for COVID-19. It would be bad if the test would also show a result for other viruses, or even unrelated molecules.

To examine this, we use the data supplied on the leaflet from the kit, `df_leaflet`.
This dataset contains for each sample one of four possibilities:

* Both tests are negative, 
* both tests are positive, 
* the PCR test is positive but the antigen test negative, 
* the PCR test is negative but the antigen positive.

We use the `yardstick` package of R`s `tidymodels` family to create the 2x2 table and analyze the specificity.

**Overthinking**: Note that the `yardstick` package is used to quantify the performance of statistical prediction models by comparing the model predictions to the true values contained in the training data. This provides us with an analogy where the antigen test can be viewed as a model that is trying the predict the outcome of the PCR test.

```{r fig.width = 3, fig.height = 3}
options(yardstick.event_first = FALSE)

cm <- yardstick::conf_mat(df_leaflet, pcr_result, ag_result)

autoplot(cm, type = "heatmap", title = "Truth = PCR test, Prediction = Antigen test")
```
From the heatmap, we see that:

* For most samples (N = 431), both tests are COVID-19 negative.
* 85 + 17 = 102 samples tested COVID-19 positive using the PCR-test
* 85 out of 102 samples that are PCR positive, are antigen test positive as well

**N.b.** The data from the leaflet is a subset of all the data from the three studies, because the data was subsetted for cases with `<= 7 days_of_symptoms`. Above, we learned that this has a positive effect on the sensitivity of the test.

For the specificity, we have to look at the samples were the PCR test is negative, but the antigen test is positive, and compare these to all the samples that are PCR-test negative. These are the number of tests where the antigen test picked up a non-specific signal. One minus this percentage gives the specificity (1 - 4/435 = 431/435):

```{r}
yardstick::spec(df2, pcr_result, ag_result)
```

Thus , we find that the antigen test is highly specific, with around 1% of false positives.

# Specificity and Sensitivity: credible intervals consistent with the data

So far, we did not discuss the sampling variability in the estimated specificity and sensitivity.

The kit leaflet mentions the following confidence intervals:

* Sensitivity 83.3% (95%CI: 74.7% - 90.0%)
* Specificity 99.1% (95%CI: 97.7% - 99.7%)

The R-package `yardstick` does not yet include confidence intervals, so I generated these using bootstrapping. I calculate both metrics for 10.000 samples sampled from the raw data. For brevity I omitted the code here, go check out my Github for R script.

The bootstrapping approach yields the following range of plausible values given the data (95% interval):

```{r}
quantile(spec_vec, probs = c(0.025, 0.975))
quantile(sens_vec, probs = c(0.025, 0.975))
```

The amount of data (N = 537) prevents us from getting an exact match to the leaflet's confidence intervals, that are based on theoretic formulas. But we do get pretty close.

Especially for the sensitivity, there is quite some uncertainty, we see that plausible values range from 76% up to 90% *for this particular cohort of patients*.


# Conclusions



Oops, no it doesnt.


From the studies it follows that ... (super high specificity, sensitivity a function of viral load).
This makes it a great tool to use.

N.b. after writing this, post, I found out that there is also a Dutch study for the Roche kit:
https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.18.20234104v1

The big difference is that the Dutch study is about the **Deep** (Nasopharyngeal) nose test, whereas the kit we have at home is the **Anterior** nose (Nasal). The conclusions are different, the NP seems much more sensitive.


Results: We included 970 persons with complete data. Overall sensitivity and specificity were 84.9% (CI95% 79.1-89.4) and 99.5% (CI95% 98.7-99.8) which translated into a positive predictive value of 97.5% (CI95% 94.0-99.5) under the current regional PCR positivity of 19.2%. Sensitivity for people with high loads of viral RNA (ct <30, 2.17E+05 E gene copy/ml = 5.3 on the log scale) and who presented within 7 days since symptom onset increased to 95.8% (CI95% 90.5-98.2).
